In addition to accurate predictions, the model should also identify and emphasize the key factors that significantly influence water quality.\n",

        "Participants will be provided with a dataset containing three water quality parameters — **Total Alkalinity**, **Electrical Conductance**, and **Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus** — collected between 2011 and 2015 from approximately 200 river locations across South Africa. Each data point includes the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the sampling site, the date of collection, and the corresponding water quality measurements.\n",

        "Before initiating model training, we may need to perform various data preprocessing steps. Here, we demonstrate scaling of the variables **SWIR22**, **NDMI**, **MNDWI**, and **PET** using StandardScaler.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature scaling is an essential preprocessing step for numerical features. Many machine learning algorithms—such as gradient descent methods, KNN, and linear or logistic regression—require scaling to achieve optimal performance. Scikit-learn provides several scaling utilities. In this notebook, we use **StandardScaler**, which transforms the data so that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Training\n",
        "Now that we have the data in a format suitable for machine learning, we can begin training our models. In this demonstration notebook, we build three separate regression models—one for each target water quality parameter: **Total Alkalinity**, **Electrical Conductance**, and **Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus**. Each model is trained independently to capture the unique relationships between the satellite-derived features and each water quality parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use the **Random Forest Regressor** from the scikit-learn library for model training. Scikit-learn offers a wide range of regression algorithms, along with powerful parameter tuning and customization options.\n",
        "\n",
        "For model training, the predictor variables (e.g., SWIR22, NDMI, MNDWI, and PET) are stored in an array `X`, and the response variable (one of the water quality parameters) is stored in an array `Y`. Note that the response variable should not be included in `X`. Also, latitude, longitude, and sample date are excluded from the predictor variables since they serve only as spatial and temporal references.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Evaluation\n",
        "After training the models for the three water quality parameters, the next step is to evaluate their performance. Each regression model—Total Alkalinity, Electrical Conductance, and Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus—is assessed using:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **R² Score**: Measures how well the model explains the variance in the observed values.  \n",
        "- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Quantifies the average magnitude of prediction errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these metrics help determine how effectively each model captures variations in water quality across locations and sampling dates. Scikit-learn provides built-in functions to compute both metrics. Participants may also explore additional evaluation techniques or custom metrics to enhance model assessment.\n"
