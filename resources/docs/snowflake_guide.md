## 2026 Challenge: Optimizing Clean Water Supply
The global competition invites university students, early career professionals, and EY employees to use AI and data to tackle access to clean, safe water.

## Challenge Overview
**Objective**: Build a machine learning model to predict Total Alkalinity, Electrical Conductance, and Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus across river locations in South Africa.
**Datasets**: 2011-2015 measurements from ~200 locations, plus geographic coordinates and collection dates.

### Prerequisites & Learning
- Python and Jupyter notebook experience.
- Learn to run Python/SQL in Snowflake, access geospatial data (Microsoft Planetary Computer), and build ML models.

## Setup Instructions
